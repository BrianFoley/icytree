phylo.js
========

This is a compact JavaScript library which provides the ability to
parse ranked, timed, phylogenetic trees and networks expressed in
Newick and NEXUS formats and visualize the result using SVG.  This can
be used to easily build client-side web apps for visualising and
manipulating these objects.

The library files are `phylo.*.js`.  The files `icytree.*` constitute an
example web app, which is also hosted at http://git.io/icytree.  The
project's web site at http://git.io/phylo.js contains a simpler
example of an embedded tree visualisation.

This software is free (as in freedom). It is made available under the
terms of the GNU General Public Licence version 3, which is contained
