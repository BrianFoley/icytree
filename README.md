phylo.js
========

This is a compact JavaScript library which provides the ability to
parse ranked, timed, phylogenetic trees and networks expressed in
Newick and NEXUS formats and visualize the result using SVG.  This can
be used to easily build client-side web apps for visualising and
manipulating these objects.
